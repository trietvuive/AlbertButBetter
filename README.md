# AlbertButBetter
IN PROGRESS </br>
Are you fucking tired of Albert? Wanna use something that doesn't suck absolute balls? </br>
Here it is! (kinda) </br>
Schedule registration for NYU's Albert. Also used as scheduling tool. </br>
Using Python to implement the backtracking algorithm for scheduling. Will use Selenium/Schedge to get the schedule automatically.</br>
Will probably need you to put your username & password, but will totally not going to send your password over the cloud to some dark Azure server. </br>
